The love of your life is stepping into your planet this summer.
A dream you have will come true.
You must try, or hate yourself for not trying.
Your ability for accomplishment will follow with success.
It's better to be alone sometimes.
Today is your lucky day.
Never give up.
Beware of the wolf.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
A bird in hand is better than two in a bush.
